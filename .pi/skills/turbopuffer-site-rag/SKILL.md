# Turbopuffer Site RAG

This skill captures the working Jellyfish/turbopuffer RAG workflow and the planned generic Scrapling-based website workflow.

## Non-negotiable guardrails

- Do **not** persist API keys, Proton Pass output, tokens, private vault names, private item titles, or share IDs to disk.
- Do **not** run live turbopuffer writes, namespace deletion, namespace replacement, or live evals unless the user explicitly approves that action in the current conversation.
- Default all crawl/index commands to dry-run/local-only.
- Use open-source/local components where practical:
  - local embeddings: `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`
  - scraper/crawler: Scrapling
  - package manager: `uv`
- Respect crawl ethics by default: same-site only, `robots_txt_obey = True`, conservative concurrency, crawl delay, and no paywall/auth/protection bypass unless explicitly authorized.
- When answering from a site index, retrieve context first and cite retrieved page titles/URLs.

## Existing Jellyfish namespace

Use this when the user asks Jellyfish questions or asks about the current live prototype.

- Turbopuffer region: `gcp-us-central1`
- Namespace: `jellyfish-site-docs-v1`
- Rows/chunks indexed: `12,721`
- Embedding model: `BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`
- Vector type: `[384]f16`
- Retrieval: local query embedding + turbopuffer hybrid `multi_query` with ANN + boosted BM25 + RRF.
- Corpus source: `jellyfish-site-docs/`

See [Jellyfish namespace reference](references/jellyfish-namespace.md) for exact credential and retrieval workflow.

## Generic Scrapling site workflow

Use this when building or testing the “base URL → crawl → chunks → namespace → search” workflow.

The polished workflow is Terraform-like:

1. `turbo-search plan`: local-only preview. Crawl with Scrapling, extract Markdown, chunk, compare with local applied state, and write review artifacts. No credentials, embeddings, namespace creation, or turbopuffer calls.
2. `turbo-search apply` without `--approve`: local-only preflight. Re-read the saved plan, verify artifacts, recompute the local diff, and report what would happen. No credentials, embeddings, or turbopuffer calls.
3. `turbo-search apply --approve`: explicit live path. Require `TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY` in the environment, embed/upsert only new or changed chunks, and update local applied state after success.
4. `--delete-stale`: extra delete guardrail. Stale rows are retained by default; live stale deletion requires both `--approve` and `--delete-stale`.

Plan artifacts are Markdown/JSON-first: `plan.json`, `summary.json`, `manifest.json`, `chunks.jsonl`, and `pages/*.md`. Local applied state lives under `.turbo-search/state/...` and is gitignored.

See [Scrapling site workflow](references/scrapling-site-workflow.md) for commands and design notes.

## Dry-run Scrapling crawler

Prefer the first-class CLI from the repository root:

```bash
uv run turbo-search crawl \
  --base-url "https://scrapling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" \
  --max-pages 10 \
  --max-chunks 100 \
  --css-selector ".md-content__inner" \
  --json
```

This command must report `dry_run: true` and `turbopuffer_api_calls: false`.

The older local-only helper remains at `scripts/scrapling_dry_crawl.py` for skill-level experimentation, but production workflow should use `turbo-search crawl`.

## Live apply checklist

Only proceed if the user explicitly asks for a live generic site apply.

1. Run `turbo-search plan` first and inspect `summary.json`, `plan.json`, `manifest.json`, `chunks.jsonl`, and generated `pages/*.md`.
2. Run apply preflight without approval:

```bash
uv run turbo-search apply \
  --plan <plan-dir>/plan.json \
  --namespace <approved-namespace> \
  --json
```

3. Confirm the namespace, rows to upsert, embeddings to generate, stale row counts, and whether stale deletion is desired. Default: retain stale rows; never delete namespaces here.
4. Retrieve the turbopuffer API key into shell memory only and set environment variables only in the active shell:

```bash
export TURBOPUFFER_REGION=gcp-us-central1
export TURBOPUFFER_NAMESPACE=<approved-namespace>
export TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY=<retrieved into shell memory only>
```

5. Run approved apply only after explicit approval:

```bash
uv run turbo-search apply \
  --plan <plan-dir>/plan.json \
  --namespace <approved-namespace> \
  --approve \
  --json
```

6. Delete stale rows only when explicitly requested with both `--approve` and `--delete-stale`.
7. Record evidence with counts and command shape, never secret values, private vault names, item titles, share IDs, or token/API-key values.
