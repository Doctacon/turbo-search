# Migrating from turbo-search to Buoy

Buoy 0.2 changes the product, package, import, command, and default state-root names without renaming existing plans, rows, or remote namespaces.

## Command and Python package

Use `buoy` for new commands:

```bash
uv run buoy --help
```

The deprecated `turbo-search` console alias remains available through 0.3 and prints a warning to stderr. It is scheduled for removal in 0.4.

Python imports make a clean break: replace `turbo_search` with `buoy_search`. There is no old import shim.

```bash
uv run python -m buoy_search --help
uv run python -m buoy_search.autoresearch --help
```

## Environment variables

Use `BUOY_EMBEDDING_MODEL` instead of `TURBO_SEARCH_EMBEDDING_MODEL`. In 0.2, the old variable is accepted with a warning only when the new variable is absent. If both are set differently, Buoy stops rather than guessing.

Turbopuffer-owned variables are unchanged:

```text
TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY
TURBOPUFFER_REGION
TURBOPUFFER_NAMESPACE
```

## Local state

New projects default to `.buoy/`. Existing state is never copied, moved, merged, or deleted automatically.

- Only `.buoy` exists, or neither root exists: Buoy uses `.buoy`.
- Only `.turbo-search` exists: Buoy uses it in place and warns.
- Both exist: Buoy stops and asks you to choose with `--state-root`.
- Explicit `--state-root`: that path always wins.

This prevents two local DuckDB ledgers from silently diverging.

## Existing plans and remote data

Schema-supported plans that record `.turbo-search` paths remain valid when that root is selected. The rebrand does not change artifact hashes, deterministic row IDs, existing Turbopuffer namespace names, or applied state history. It does not trigger re-embedding or remote writes by itself.

The GitHub repository and package registry are separate release operations; this guide does not imply either external rename or publication has occurred.
