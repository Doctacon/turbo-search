# Generic site/repository/local-document RAG plan/apply workflow

This workflow is the Terraform-like path for turning a public website crawl, public GitHub repository, or supported local document file into a reviewed, incremental turbopuffer index.

## Safety model

There are three distinct modes:

1. **Plan**: local-only preview. Crawls or converts, extracts, chunks, compares with local applied state, and writes review artifacts. It does not read credentials, load embeddings, create namespaces, or call turbopuffer.
2. **Apply preflight**: local-only verification of a saved plan. It recomputes artifact hashes and local diff state. It does not read credentials, load embeddings, or call turbopuffer.
3. **Approved apply**: explicit live mutation. It requires `--approve` and `TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY` in the environment. It embeds/upserts only new or changed chunks from the recomputed diff.

Stale deletes have an additional guardrail: stale rows are retained by default. Live stale deletion requires both `--approve` and `--delete-stale`.

## Plan

Website example:

```bash
uv run turbo-search plan \
  "https://scrapling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" \
  --out-dir artifacts/site-crawls/scrapling-readthedocs-io-plan \
  --css-selector ".md-content__inner"
```

GitHub repository example:

```bash
uv run turbo-search plan https://github.com/Doctacon/open-streaming-lab
```

GitHub repository URLs are detected automatically and ingested from git-tracked repository contents, not rendered GitHub UI pages. The default namespace is repo-specific, e.g. `github-doctacon-open-streaming-lab-v1`.

Local document example:

```bash
uv run turbo-search plan ./Research\ Notes.csv
```

Local document paths are detected automatically when the path points to one existing supported file. v1 converts the whole file with Microsoft MarkItDown and does not emit page, slide, sheet, cell, line, or notebook-cell citations.

Supported extensions are `.pdf`, `.docx`, `.pptx`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`, `.csv`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.txt`, `.text`, `.md`, `.markdown`, `.json`, `.jsonl`, `.xml`, `.ipynb`, and `.epub`.

PDF namespaces stay backward-compatible, e.g. `pdf-research-notes-<sha16>-v1`. Non-PDF local documents use `file-<ext>-<filename-slug>-<sha16>-v1`, e.g. `file-csv-research-notes-<sha16>-v1`. Generated artifacts use a synthetic `pdf://...` or `file://...` document URL plus filename/extension/hash metadata rather than the absolute local source filepath.

Plan artifacts:

```text
plan.json
summary.json
manifest.json
chunks.jsonl
pages/*.md
```

The plan compares generated chunks to local applied state under `.turbo-search/state/...` unless `--state-root` is supplied. `.turbo-search/` is local state and is gitignored.

### Crawl discovery strategy

`plan` and `crawl` support `--crawl-strategy`:

- `sitemap` (default): use robots/sitemap discovery; fall back to link crawling only when the sitemap path yields no pages.
- `link`: ignore sitemap URLs and crawl same-site links from the base URL.
- `hybrid`: merge robots/sitemap pages with same-site link crawling from the base URL. Use this explicit exhaustive mode when a sitemap is known to be partial.

All crawl strategies obey robots.txt, host restrictions, page caps, concurrency, and delay settings. Default website planning caps are `3000` pages and `120000` chunks; default GitHub repository caps are `5000` repo files, `100000` chunks, and `51200` bytes per text file. Lower them for smoke tests or raise them for unusually large sources. Interactive progress uses `cap=` for crawl limits and, during sitemap crawl, shows a sitemap-derived page estimate after matching sitemap URLs are discovered.

For sitemap-heavy versioned docs sites, the default docs version policy is `warn`: detect repeated `/docs/{version}/...` families and stop before page crawling so the user chooses intentionally. Use `--docs-version-policy latest` to keep moving current docs such as `/docs/latest/**`, `--docs-version-policy stable-latest` to keep the highest semantic version, `--docs-version-policy latest-nightly` to keep current plus preview docs, or `--docs-version-policy all` to keep every version.

For sitemap-heavy multilingual sites, the default language policy is `english`: detect locale-prefixed URL families such as `/de/**`, `/fr/**`, `/pt-br/**`, or `/zh-cn/**`, then add effective excludes for non-English locale prefixes while keeping unprefixed and `/en/**` pages. Use `--language-policy all` when every language should be indexed.

### Path filters and URL canonicalization

Use repeatable path globs to shape the local corpus before a live apply:

```bash
uv run turbo-search plan https://turbopuffer.com/ \
  --exclude-path /llms-full.txt
```

For websites:

- `--include-path /docs/**` includes only matching URL paths; `/docs/**` also matches `/docs`.
- `--exclude-path /llms-full.txt` removes matching URL paths from sitemap and link discovery.
- trailing slashes are stripped by default so `/docs/query` and `/docs/query/` canonicalize to one page.
- `--keep-trailing-slash` preserves trailing-slash variants when a site needs that behavior.

For GitHub repositories, `--include-path` and `--exclude-path` match repo-relative file paths. Default repo planning excludes generated/vendor directories plus local agent memory/run artifacts such as `.10x/`, `.loom/`, `.pi/`, `.turbo-search/`, `artifacts/`, `autoresearch/`, and eval fixture JSON under `/data/` so repository search stays focused on source, tests, and user-facing docs. Repo-ranking experiments can opt into larger text files with `--repo-max-file-bytes`, searchable path/Python-symbol metadata inside generated code pages with `--repo-search-metadata`, or separate searchable metadata card pages with `--repo-file-cards`; these options do not change default repo planning.

```bash
uv run turbo-search plan https://github.com/owner/repo --include-path 'docs/**'
uv run turbo-search plan https://github.com/owner/repo --exclude-path 'dist/**'
uv run turbo-search plan https://github.com/owner/repo --repo-max-file-bytes 200000 --repo-search-metadata
uv run turbo-search plan https://github.com/owner/repo --repo-file-cards
```

## Apply preflight

```bash
uv run turbo-search apply
```

By default, `apply` selects the newest `artifacts/site-crawls/**/plan.json` and uses the namespace recorded in that plan. Pass `--json` for scripts/automation. Pass `--plan <plan.json>` or `--namespace <namespace>` only when you want to override those defaults.

Preflight verifies:

- plan schema and namespace;
- `manifest.json` and `chunks.jsonl` match;
- embedding-text hashes are still valid;
- artifact hash matches reviewed content/options;
- local applied state is compatible.

Preflight makes no live calls and does not read `TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY`.

## Approved apply

Only after reviewing plan artifacts and accepting the namespace shown by preflight:

```bash
uv run turbo-search apply --approve
```

Approved apply:

- requires `TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY` from the environment;
- embeds only rows selected by the freshly recomputed diff;
- upserts only those rows;
- updates local applied state only after successful live work;
- retains stale rows by default as `retained_stale` in local state.

Do not store API keys, private vault names, item titles, share IDs, or token values in files.

## Stale delete guardrail

Preview exact stale deletes without live calls:

```bash
uv run turbo-search apply --delete-stale
```

Actually delete stale rows only with both flags:

```bash
uv run turbo-search apply --approve --delete-stale
```

`--delete-stale` deletes exact stale row IDs from the recomputed diff. It does not delete namespaces.

## Retrieval and eval validation

After a site has been applied with explicit approval, retrieval and eval commands can target that generic namespace with CLI overrides. Dry-run retrieval planning remains local-only:

```bash
uv run turbo-search retrieve \
  "How does Scrapling LinkExtractor filter links?" \
  --dry-run \
  --namespace site-scrapling-readthedocs-io-v1 \
  --region gcp-us-central1 \
  --json
```

List the Scrapling docs eval cases without credentials or live calls:

```bash
uv run turbo-search evals \
  --dry-run \
  --dataset src/turbo_search/data/scrapling_retrieval_smoke_evals.json \
  --namespace site-scrapling-readthedocs-io-v1 \
  --json
```

Live generic retrieval/evals remain explicitly gated by `--live` and `TURBOPUFFER_API_KEY` in the environment:

```bash
uv run turbo-search evals \
  --live \
  --dataset src/turbo_search/data/scrapling_retrieval_smoke_evals.json \
  --namespace site-scrapling-readthedocs-io-v1 \
  --json
```

Do not run live retrieval/evals unless the namespace has been applied and the user explicitly approves live validation.

Retrieval defaults to namespace-aware final ranking after hybrid ANN + BM25 + RRF. `site-*`, `pdf-*`, and `file-*` namespaces use page/document-level ranking by default (`--ranking-mode page --ranking-profile none --ranking-pool 20 --ranking-aggregation max`). GitHub repository namespaces use file-level `repo-code` ranking by default (`--ranking-mode file --ranking-profile repo-code --ranking-pool 100 --ranking-aggregation adaptive-sum-3`), deduplicating by `repo_path`, using the best chunk per file plus a small close-chunk evidence bonus, gently demoting process/docs/eval-artifact paths such as `.pi/`, `.10x/`, `.loom/`, `autoresearch/`, `docs/`, Markdown files, and eval fixture JSON, lightly boosting `tests/` files, applying conservative query-aware path/symbol boosts for exact source/doc filename or Python def/class matches, and optionally promoting one strong doc/test companion into the top five without replacing the top implementation hit. Pass `--ranking-aggregation max` for strict single-best-chunk file ranking, `--ranking-aggregation capped-sum-3` to fully reward up to three matching chunks from the same file, or `--ranking-mode chunk --ranking-profile none` when validating raw fused chunk order.

### Repository composite evals and config autoresearch

Repository search evals support graded judgments for expected source files and
report both component metrics and a weighted composite:

```text
repo_search_score = 100 * (0.55 * NDCG@10 + 0.20 * Recall@10 + 0.15 * MRR@10 + 0.10 * Precision@5)
```

The first seed dataset for this repository is:

```text
src/turbo_search/data/turbo_search_repo_search_seed_evals.json
```

Each case has a `question` and `judgments`; each judgment uses repo-relative
`repo_path`, optional `url`/`section_path`, integer `grade` in `[0, 3]`, and a
`reason`. The dataset metadata marks the labels as `seed-draft` and
`human_approved_ground_truth: false`, so treat the labels as calibration data
until reviewed.

Run one safe fixture-mode autoresearch experiment with no credentials or live
calls:

```bash
uv run python -m turbo_search.autoresearch \
  --experiment autoresearch/experiments/repo-search-fixture-baseline.json \
  --out /tmp/turbo-search-repo-search-fixture-baseline \
  --json
```

The runner is config-only and one-shot. It writes `plan.json`, `result.json`,
and `report.md`; live mode is retrieval-only against an already-applied
namespace and does not apply, upsert, delete stale rows, delete namespaces, or
update local applied state.

## What is still not automatic

- Remote/shared state is not implemented; state is local-first.
- Local document OCR/image captioning, audio/video transcription, YouTube, remote file URLs, Azure/cloud converters, archives/directories, MarkItDown plugins, and page/slide/sheet/cell/line citations are not implemented.
- Live generic applies/deletes/retrievals/evals should only be run when explicitly approved for the current site/namespace.
- Live SDK compatibility should be validated on a disposable namespace before relying on generic apply for production use.
