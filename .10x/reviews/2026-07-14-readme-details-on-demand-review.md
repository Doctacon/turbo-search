# README Details-on-Demand Review

## Findings

The first editorial and technical reviews found two significant accuracy defects: README wording obscured that planning fetches public remote sources, and the crawl reference stated per-domain concurrency 1 instead of the implemented default 4. Both were repaired.

Final review verified:

- README is 91 lines / 400 words and keeps the complete first-run workflow near the top;
- public-source fetching is distinguished from Turbopuffer credentials, embeddings, calls, writes, and searches;
- websites, public GitHub repositories, and local documents are immediately discoverable;
- detailed indexing, retrieval, and evaluation behavior has one focused canonical home each;
- crawl, state, cleanup, timing, ranking, and eval claims match current source;
- no unimplemented float16 inference behavior is presented as current;
- local links resolve and no active user/skill document targets the removed all-purpose guide.

## Evidence

- `.10x/evidence/2026-07-13-readme-details-on-demand-rewrite.md`
- Final independent review: `.pi-subagents/artifacts/outputs/68324d61-061f-4485-8972-808596a5f966/review/readme-details-on-demand-final.md`
- Parent validation: 206 tests passed; `git diff --check` passed; local links in README and all focused docs resolved.

## Residual risk

External web links were not network-checked. Live-shaped examples were parser-validated and deliberately not executed.
