# Direct Command Defaults Shaping Review

## Target

The active decisions, specifications, parent plan, and three child tickets for live-by-default retrieval, the JSON applied-state hard cutover, and interactive apply confirmation in `work/shape-direct-command-defaults`.

## Findings

Independent review initially identified and the parent corrected four significant coherence defects:

1. The hard-cutover child no longer requires cancellation behavior introduced only by its dependent interactive-confirmation child.
2. First-apply semantics are limited to an absent or valid initialized empty DuckDB ledger; unreadable, corrupt, schema-incompatible, and identity-invalid DuckDB state retains fail-closed behavior.
3. DuckDB commits after successful content-namespace writes and before remote catalog registration; later catalog failure preserves the committed ledger and follows pending recovery.
4. Supersession paths and the malformed interactive-spec reference were repaired.

Final independent review found no remaining blocker. It confirmed:

- `.10x/decisions/duckdb-only-applied-state-hard-cutover.md` makes DuckDB sole applied-state authority and makes obsolete JSON files inert without affecting unrelated compatibility;
- `.10x/specs/compact-duckdb-applied-state.md` preserves content-failure, content-success, catalog-partial-success, locking, and invalid-state contracts;
- `.10x/specs/approved-apply-remote-catalog-registration.md` agrees with the ledger-before-catalog sequence;
- `.10x/tickets/2026-07-18-remove-legacy-json-applied-state.md` is executable without semantic invention.

## Verdict

Pass. The shaping graph is ready for the first child ticket. No implementation was performed during shaping.

## Residual risk

Active source and documentation still implement and describe the old defaults and JSON migration until the bounded child tickets execute, validate, integrate, and close in sequence. The pass establishes record coherence, not implementation completion.
