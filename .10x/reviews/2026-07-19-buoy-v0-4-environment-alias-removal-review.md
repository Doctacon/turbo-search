# Buoy 0.4 Environment Alias Removal Review

## Target

PR #48 at reviewed implementation head `6d9e050176c46722a89c5daa00bbc872efb0fc2a`.

## Findings

Independent review confirmed the centralized post-parse/pre-dispatch gate covers primary, catalog, module, and autoresearch command paths; preserves help/version and parser-failure precedence; detects presence including empty values without reading or printing values; emits the exact ordered diagnostic with exit 2 and empty stdout; and blocks handlers before credential, config, filesystem/state/artifact/DuckDB, prompt, network, or remote effects.

Tests cover each primary and catalog command family, JSON output, both variable orders/values, CLI overrides, approved/preview/dry-run/declined cases, non-dispatch sentinel behavior, and autoresearch non-read/non-write behavior. Migration/changelog guidance matches the contract. Exact-head hosted Python 3.11, Python 3.13, and distribution checks passed.

The branch intentionally leaves candidate version metadata and console-alias removal to the sibling ticket.

## Verdict

The bounded child passes. Integration remains blocked by the governing parent plan until both reviewed child branches are assembled and reconciled as one 0.4.0 candidate. The child ticket remains active.

## Residual risk

Aggregate validation must reconcile shared migration/changelog text, verify 0.4.0 metadata and package launchers, rerun clean-install and released-0.3.0 upgrade tests, and confirm no publication, tag, release, state/data, or remote effects.
