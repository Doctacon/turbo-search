# Repository Cleanup Plan Closure Review

## Target

`.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-18-repository-cleanup-plan.md` at develop `474526051821425a9cba649711f793dd8e89ac9d`.

## Findings

Independent read-only review confirmed the dependency and all six sequenced children are terminal with coherent evidence, review, and dependency order:

1. Thistle/Qdrant inventory, retirement, and deletion;
2. website exact-host crawl containment;
3. unreachable local-catalog persistence removal;
4. terminal ticket/reference normalization;
5. conservative stale-ticket disposition;
6. Buoy 0.4 compatibility-removal shaping.

Dirty work was inventoried before deletion; the exact-host safety slice was salvaged while Qdrant/dedup work was explicitly retired; local-card/schema/remote/migration behavior was preserved; the record graph was normalized; unsupported stale work retained an active owner; and 0.4 behavior was ratified into focused specifications and bounded owners. The subsequently approved 0.4 implementation also completed under `.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-19-buoy-v0-4-compatibility-removal-plan.md` and integrated at `474526051821425a9cba649711f793dd8e89ac9d`.

Protected ignored artifacts, active state, remote namespaces, release refs, `main`, and unrelated worktrees were not changed by the cleanup sequence.

## Verdict

Pass. The repository cleanup parent may move to done.

## Residual risk and separate owners

The following are explicitly separate and do not block this parent:

- sitemap limits (subsequently completed): `.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-18-bound-sitemap-resource-usage.md`;
- MarkItDown normalization (subsequently completed): `.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-18-restore-markitdown-control-character-normalization.md`;
- stale Scrapling workflow guidance (subsequently completed): `.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-19-reconcile-scrapling-site-workflow-direct-command-guidance.md`;
- Node action upgrade (subsequently completed): `.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-14-update-node24-github-actions.md`;
- retrieval-tag implementation: `.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-19-return-retrieval-tags.md` (shaping history: `.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-15-reconcile-retrieval-tag-output.md`);
- heavy ranking experiments: `.10x/tickets/2026-06-28-repo-search-heavy-ranking-experiments.md`.

No unowned parent residual was identified.
