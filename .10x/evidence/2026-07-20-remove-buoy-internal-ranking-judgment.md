# Remove Ratified Internal Buoy Ranking Judgment

## What was observed

Exactly one judgment was removed from `src/buoy_search/data/buoy_search_repo_search_seed_evals.json`, case `evals-composite-metrics`:

- `repo_path`: `.10x/specs/repo-search-eval-autoresearch.md`
- `grade`: `1`
- reason: `Specifies the intended metric contract and config-only autoresearch scope, but is not runtime implementation.`

A semantic comparison against `HEAD` removed that exact object from the prior JSON and then proved deep equality with the checked-in result. All 12 other dataset files were byte-equal to `HEAD`. The Buoy fixture baseline's corresponding no-longer-judged hit was removed so its stated ideal-relevant-hit contract remains accurate; no other fixture hit changed.

The revised contract loads 13 datasets, 90 unique composite identities, and 369 judgments. All 369 remaining judgment paths resolve against the unchanged checked-in source-path bundle. Buoy remains `insufficient`: path validation is complete, but baseline namespace `github-doctacon-buoy-search-v1` remains `pending_approval` and no remote contents or model compatibility were verified. C3 and all dependent comparison work remain blocked. C7/C8 retain their independent threshold gates.

## Procedure and validation

The inventory was regenerated mechanically from the checked-in dataset bytes: each dataset SHA-256 and judgment count was recomputed, bundle rows were rehashed in inventory order, path membership was re-evaluated, and the canonical payload hash was recomputed with sorted compact JSON excluding `inventory_payload_sha256`. The standard-library validator then independently reproduced the checked-in values:

```text
{"composite_identities": 90, "dataset_bundle_sha256": "5a79f58aaca87a2d4f7cbec68fdcfbbcbf041131821587f8aba74a86daca99d9", "datasets": 13, "folds": 13, "insufficient_repositories": ["buoy"], "inventory_payload_sha256": "97fb02f79e2f9ada09b19eb6e0c91f987ab4e132e906a6814f73af1bc66c50b1", "inventory_sha256": "e6f97842ec90f0558f51e70f93ea6b8f09f82f63019a27d0738d2b1efb427608", "judgments": 369, "pending_baseline_approval": ["buoy"], "source_path_manifest_bundle_sha256": "1af85ca5e1f282e18c4eaa3c634b3da9b0ffb30de09389c799bd34fe3513c697"}
```

The semantic comparison reported:

```text
{"after_buoy_sha256": "60008af2950ae8fa27da59c0af737ebf5b4a3e618680bfa113ec75951d338792", "before_buoy_sha256": "605ac5b775a0b9ce2fc6adb78c4de9ee98a597ec9c8b4cd91e0712b2ed6e8eaf", "buoy_semantics_equal_after_exact_removal": true, "other_dataset_files_byte_equal": 12, "removed_exact_judgments": 1}
```

Validation results:

- Python 3.11: validator passed; 5 focused contract tests passed; 446 full tests passed.
- Python 3.13: validator passed; 5 focused contract tests passed; 446 full tests passed.
- CI-equivalent locked syncs passed on both interpreters; wheel and source distribution built successfully.
- PR #60 hosted checks passed: Python 3.11, Python 3.13, and Build distributions.
- After incorporating `origin/develop` `72d1344`, final closure reruns passed on Python 3.11 and 3.13: validator, 5 focused contract tests, and 446 full tests on each interpreter. Recomputed file hashes and semantic comparison exactly matched the values above.
- `git diff --check` passed.

The first Python 3.11 full-suite attempt correctly exposed that the sample ideal fixture still returned the removed internal path and scored `99.66666666666666` instead of `100.0`. Removing only that stale fixture hit restored the fixture's stated all-relevant-hits behavior; both complete reruns then passed.

## Safety and limits

All validation was local. No namespace, catalog, model, credential, provider, retrieval, or remote state was read or mutated. No model was loaded or downloaded. No retrieval/provider/live namespace query ran. No namespace/catalog/default write or delete occurred.

This evidence proves the checked-in dataset, contract hashes, local path membership, and test outcomes. It does not approve, create, populate, inspect, or verify `github-doctacon-buoy-search-v1`; does not establish Buoy model/corpus compatibility; and does not unblock C3 or dependent work. Independent review passed the seven-file semantic change at PR #60 head `ac9bb34549a0bc172ad01a60f6d94512b48a9052` with the residuals recorded in `.10x/reviews/2026-07-20-remove-buoy-internal-ranking-judgment-review.md`.
