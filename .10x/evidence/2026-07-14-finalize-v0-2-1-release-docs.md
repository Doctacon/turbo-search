# Finalize v0.2.1 Release Documentation

## What was observed

- Published GitHub Release v0.2.1 was independently verified before documentation finalization.
- CHANGELOG now records `[0.2.1] - 2026-07-14`, canonical release and Unreleased compare links, and preserved unreleased v0.2.0 history.
- The release ticket is done with a durable pass review; parent progress/outcome/children now describe v0.2.1 and the finalization gate accurately.
- Temporal references use terminal ticket paths.

## Validation

```text
PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 uv run python -m unittest tests.test_release_automation -q
Ran 9 tests; OK

PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -q
Ran 235 tests; OK

uv lock --check
git diff --check
PASS
```

A release-automation regression now asserts the verified changelog date and canonical links. No tag, release, asset, PyPI, branch-protection, or product behavior changed.

## Commit, push, and hosted CI

Commit `f4ba77360912a6f72f514c31fd2c311145e65285` (`docs: finalize v0.2.1 release`) was pushed normally to canonical `origin/main`. Hosted CI run `29363465444` completed successfully on that exact commit.

## Limits

The owning ticket remains active pending required independent review. The unrelated untracked Oscilar ticket was excluded from staging and commit.
