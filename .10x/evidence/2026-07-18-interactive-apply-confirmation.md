# Interactive Apply Confirmation Implementation Evidence

## What was observed

- Apply mode selection rejects `--dry-run --approve` and plain non-TTY stdin before state-root resolution or plan selection. The diagnostic names `--dry-run` and `--approve`; a piped `yes` is not accepted.
- Explicit `apply --dry-run` remains prompt-free, model-free, credential-free, API-free, and non-mutating. Its JSON reports `approved=false`, `dry_run=true`, `cancelled=false`, `confirmation=not_requested`, `state_updated=false`, and `catalog_updated=false`.
- Plain TTY apply renders complete preflight before the exact stderr prompt `Apply this plan? [y/N] `. Surrounding whitespace and case are normalized, but only exact `y` or `yes` confirms.
- Enter, `no`, arbitrary input, EOF, prompt-read failure, and prompt-output failure exit 0 as safe cancellation. JSON stdout is one parseable object with `dry_run=false`, `cancelled=true`, `confirmation=declined_or_unavailable`, and false API/state/catalog effects; text states `Apply cancelled; nothing was written.`
- Call-order instrumentation observed visible preflight, prompt read, config loading, namespace-lock acquisition, approved revalidation, and model construction in that order. Interactive confirmation enters the unchanged `run_approved_apply` pipeline, whose protective state/lock/pending/content/catalog/cleanup suites remain passing.
- Obsolete `last-applied.json` and `legacy-json/last-applied.json` fixtures remained inode/size/mtime/byte identical through dry-run, cancellation, and confirmed interactive apply. Production source contains no obsolete-JSON recognition.
- Existing prompt-free `--approve`, stale deletion, depth-one batching/timing, lock contention, content/state/catalog ordering, pending recovery, plan retention/cleanup, and partial-success tests remain passing.

## Procedure

```

The full suites emit two expected warnings from existing cleanup safety tests that deliberately present plan paths under the state root; the suites still pass.

## What this supports or challenges

This supports the ticket's local behavior, output, ordering, compatibility, inert obsolete-state, and regression-preservation criteria on Python 3.11 and 3.13. It also supports reproducible distribution construction and source cleanliness.

## Limits

- All content/model/API effects were faked; no live Turbopuffer, credential-provider, catalog, namespace, or external data mutation occurred.
- Hosted run `29692276509` validates implementation commit `7b6d684`; the final evidence-only metadata commit triggers a second equivalent PR run, whose identity is reported at handoff rather than recursively mutating this record.
- Independent review is intentionally not performed by this implementation session; the ticket remains active.
