# Turbo Search Site Planning Workflow

For a new public website, the shortest local-only planning command is:

```bash
uv run turbo-search plan "https://example.com/"
```

From 2026-07-02 onward, interactive text-mode `plan` and `crawl` runs show a default one-line progress indicator on stderr. It updates in place with crawl/plan phases so long crawls do not feel stalled and do not spam terminal output. The renderer truncates messages to terminal width so long URLs do not soft-wrap into apparent new lines. Progress labels use `cap=` for crawl limits; sitemap crawl labels add a sitemap-derived URL estimate when available instead of treating the cap as the known total.

Default website planning caps are `3000` pages and `120000` chunks. Use lower caps for smoke tests or when you only need a subset.

Default website crawl strategy is `--crawl-strategy sitemap`: use robots/sitemap discovery and fall back to link crawling only when sitemap discovery yields no pages. Use `--crawl-strategy link` to force link-only crawling, or `--crawl-strategy hybrid` to explicitly crawl sitemap pages and then same-site links before merging both results.

Default website docs-version behavior is `--docs-version-policy warn`: detect repeated sitemap families such as `/docs/1.10.2/**`, `/docs/latest/**`, and `/docs/nightly/**`, then stop before page crawling so the user chooses intentionally. For duplicated version docs, prefer `--docs-version-policy latest` for moving current docs, `stable-latest` for the highest semantic version, `latest-nightly` for current plus preview docs, or `all` to keep every version.

Default website language behavior is `--language-policy english`: when sitemap analysis detects a multilingual locale-prefix family, keep unprefixed and `/en/**` pages while adding effective excludes for detected non-English locale prefixes such as `/de/**`, `/fr/**`, `/pt-br/**`, or `/zh-cn/**`. Use `--language-policy all` when the intended index includes every language.

Progress behavior:

- enabled by default only for interactive terminals;
- suppressed automatically for `--json`;
- suppressed automatically when stderr is not a TTY, such as redirected logs or CI;
- disabled explicitly with `--no-progress`.

Useful bounded planning variants:

```bash
uv run turbo-search plan "https://example.com/" --max-pages 10 --max-chunks 200
uv run turbo-search plan "https://example.com/" --include-path "/docs/**" --max-pages 100
uv run turbo-search plan "https://example.com/" --crawl-strategy hybrid
```

After inspecting the plan, preflight with:

```bash
uv run turbo-search apply
```

Only use `uv run turbo-search apply --approve` after explicit approval for live turbopuffer writes.
