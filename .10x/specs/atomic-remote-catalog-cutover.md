# Atomic Remote Catalog Cutover

## Purpose and scope

Stage remote backend primitives without changing authority, then switch catalog CLI, approved apply, and automatic retrieval together only after reviewed remote seed state exists. Prevent local/remote split-brain and bind deletion to the exact canonical file.

## Two-phase rollout

### Phase 1: inert backend

The first child may integrate remote schema/serializer/read/write primitives and tests. It MUST NOT change public catalog CLI, apply, retrieval, help/docs, local catalog reads/writes, or create a live remote namespace.

### Phase 2: one authority cutover

One cutover child owns public catalog CLI, approved apply, automatic retrieval, live seed, integration, and local-file deletion. No intermediate public authority is merged.

## Mutation freeze

From live seed preflight until the cutover PR merges and post-merge verification completes:

- no `buoy catalog` mutation;
- no approved apply;
- no edits to `.buoy/catalog.json`;
- ordinary local-catalog retrieval MAY continue before merge because seed is byte-equivalent, but no card mutation may occur;
- any local catalog hash/revision drift, remote card drift, target namespace drift, or competing PR/ref change aborts cutover.

The freeze and release are explicitly reported.

## Exact local deletion binding

Canonical path: `/Users/crlough/Code/personal/turbo-search/.buoy/catalog.json`.

Expected pre-cutover identity:

- regular non-symlink file;
- size 26,063 bytes;
- SHA-256 `aafe3e6752671badef9da1aa0150903056bb856666289c271e0a67cef7a5ab1a`;
- catalog revision `cd77c5ce97dd7f8df82b191b9e534d0c5535c7fa5224ef81edcbacb7732b01e6`;
- Dagster card revision `6b063015a1864c449a31df15f61201903c631a63011801f06163e2d47292ba9c`;
- Oscilar card revision `4213e01252e99a8b92829fd021933525666bd259a834191216d979739f456ff1`.

Expected lock path: `/Users/crlough/Code/personal/turbo-search/.buoy/catalog.json.lock`; inspection found it absent. If it exists or appears at either cutover deletion check, deletion MUST block. No process may unlink a lock path while holding or after releasing an inode that could be replaced. No catalog pending registration may exist. Any mismatch blocks deletion.

Delete neither `.buoy` nor any other state. Only when the lock path is absent before and immediately after final catalog identity revalidation may the exact catalog file be deleted. Recheck that the lock remains absent and catalog path absent afterward; otherwise record a blocker without deleting anything else.

## Seed and cutover sequence

1. Complete implementation and independent review on task branch; required PR checks pass.
2. Enter freeze and revalidate exact local identity, exact remote main/develop/PR head, four content-live namespaces, and reserved namespace state.
3. Seed according to remote catalog migration preconditions. Final strong proof: exactly two intended cards, no extras/conflicts; five listed total including control plane; two missing-card content targets.
4. With branch code, perform authenticated read-only automatic previews from canonical checkout and unrelated temporary directory; both select the same route/intersection. Make no content query.
5. Revalidate local hash/revision and remote stable card set immediately before integration.
6. Integrate the exact reviewed PR into develop through required checks.
7. From integrated develop, repeat two-directory remote previews and explicit local dry preview; verify catalog CLI and approved-apply preflight contracts.
8. Revalidate exact local file identity plus absent lock/pending state, then delete only the bound local catalog file; any lock appearance blocks.
9. Prove default remote operation no longer reads local state and release freeze.
10. Record live reads/writes, affected IDs, checks, deletion identity, and limits; close only after independent review.

If integration fails after seed, retain the local catalog and freeze; remote seed is idempotent. If post-merge verification fails, retain the local catalog for evidence even though integrated code ignores it, open a blocker, and do not claim cutover complete.

## External side effects authorized

The user authorized:

- create/update only `buoy-routing-catalog-v1` in `gcp-us-central1` with exactly two card rows;
- read namespace inventory/catalog metadata/cards for verification;
- delete only the exact bound local catalog after success; lock presence blocks deletion.

Not authorized: content namespace queries/writes/deletes, extra cards, cross-region operations, remote catalog deletion, live content retrieval/evals, protection changes, or other filesystem deletion.

## Acceptance scenarios

Absent, one-card partial, exact complete, and conflict/extra remote states follow the remote catalog spec. Every drift aborts. Successful cutover has one integrated public authority, two remote cards, two missing-card exclusions, identical cross-directory previews, no local catalog, and untouched content namespaces.
