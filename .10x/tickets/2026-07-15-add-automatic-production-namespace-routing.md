# Add Automatic Production Namespace Routing

## Outcome

Implement opt-in `retrieve --auto-route`, local dry route preview, and live catalog-routed multi-namespace retrieval under `.10x/specs/automatic-production-namespace-routing.md`.

## Branch and worktree

Execute on `work/add-automatic-production-namespace-routing` in its own worktree after apply/catalog integration is reviewed, closed, and integrated into current `develop`.

## Scope

- Add `--auto-route`, bounded `--route-top-k` default three, exact retrieve catalog-path precedence, and rejection of route-only flags outside auto-route.
- Preserve explicit namespace behavior and implement argument/environment conflict semantics exactly.
- Load/validate catalog and apply enabled/compatibility gates before scoring.
- Implement production lexical, persisted-vector semantic, and equal-weight hybrid namespace routing with existing `RRF_K`.
- Add route-aware dry-run plans that load the local pinned model but read no credentials/contact no remote service.
- Feed selected compatible cards in route order into existing multi-namespace live retrieval and downstream RRF.
- Add routed text/JSON metadata without vectors or new persistence/telemetry.
- Add focused tests for CLI/stderr-JSON separation, fixed 384 compatibility, eligibility, algorithms, dry safety, live fakes, mixed card ranking contracts plus field-level/global overrides, explicit regression, output, all-or-nothing failure, and no-download behavior.
- Update retrieval documentation.
- Record evidence and obtain independent review before closure.

## Acceptance criteria

- Automatic routing activates only with `--auto-route`; explicit retrieval does not load catalog code.
- CLI namespace conflict, environment replacement warning, route-top-k validation, and catalog overrides match the spec.
- Disabled/incompatible high-score canaries are excluded before lexical/semantic scoring.
- Hybrid route uses persisted vectors, exact lexical semantics, pinned local-only query model, imported `RRF_K=60`, deterministic ties, and pre-retrieval top-three default truncation.
- Dry preview performs no credential read, SDK construction, remote call, state/catalog mutation, model download, or vector leakage.
- Live route queries only selected cards in route order, embeds retrieval query once, preserves per-card ranking contracts/CLI overrides, reuses namespace-qualified downstream RRF, and fails without partial results.
- Routed output remains explicit even when one card is selected; existing explicit single/multi contracts remain compatible.
- No remote namespace discovery fallback, remote catalog, ACL, graph, taxonomy, tag filtering, telemetry, or online learning is added.
- Focused tests, full suite, and `git diff --check` pass.
- Independent review has no unresolved significant finding.

## Explicit exclusions

- catalog core or apply registration changes beyond necessary integrated API use;
- automatic default activation;
- routing uncataloged visible namespaces;
- concurrent or partial-success retrieval;
- query/card logging;
- production feedback learning;
- concepts/relationships/graphs.

## Evidence expectations

Evidence must prove argument and fail-closed boundaries, eligibility-before-score, deterministic route metrics/fixtures, route-order handoff, embed-once live behavior, existing RRF identity/ties, dry no-side-effect sentinels, explicit retrieval regression, output redaction, and full validation.

## Blockers

Blocked until `.10x/tickets/2026-07-15-integrate-approved-apply-catalog-registration.md` is reviewed, closed, and integrated into `develop`.

## Progress and notes

- 2026-07-15: Opened as the final sequential child; no implementation occurred.
