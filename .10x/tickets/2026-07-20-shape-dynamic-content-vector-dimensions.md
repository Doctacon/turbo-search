# Shape Dynamic Content-Vector Dimensions

## Outcome

Produce a user-legible architecture and product checkpoint for whether and how Buoy could support non-384-dimensional **content** embeddings. This is shaping only. It records the user's ratified first-candidate and containment choices and drafts the remaining exact resource checkpoint. It MUST NOT activate a behavior specification, create an executable implementation/evaluation ticket, implement plumbing, download or load weights, run inference, or perform namespace/card/catalog/default writes.

## Approval provenance

On 2026-07-20, after C2 established that no credible native 384-dimensional candidate fits the current boundary, the user explicitly approved opening separate shaping for dynamic content-vector dimensions. The approved shaping surface covers the retained 768- and 3,584-dimensional candidates, namespace schema/card/routing compatibility, isolation or migration, resource bounds, offline revision-pinned loading, and Nomic's query-only prefix.

The user then ratified four choices for the first pilot: Crow-Plus at 768 dimensions; explicit namespace only with no cards, catalogs, or automatic routing; every vector plus resource/output compliance staged and validated before the first remote content write; and separate bootstrap, bounded-measurement, implementation, and indexing/write approvals. No download, load, inference, implementation, test, or external operation was approved.

## Scope

- Compare the decision implications of:
  - `nomic-ai/nomic-embed-code@11114029805cee545ef111d5144b623787462a52` at 3,584 dimensions.
  - `Shuu12121/CodeSearch-ModernBERT-Crow-Plus@96ff525a7aa3bf8bfa90d77337c2b24bd45229af` at 768 dimensions.
- Shape how a content namespace declares and validates its embedding dimension and model contract without conflating content vectors with the independent 384-dimensional catalog-routing vector.
- Identify required namespace-card, remote-card, plan, apply-preview, compatibility, and automatic-routing contract changes and their failure behavior.
- Shape isolation and migration choices for existing 384-dimensional namespaces, including whether new-dimension experiments require separate namespaces, how incompatible namespaces are rejected, and whether any migration is necessary or should be avoided.
- Establish the resource checkpoint needed before any future download or load: exact pinned bytes, disk cache, construction and steady-state host RAM, device memory, precision/loading strategy, supported hardware, and abort bounds.
- Shape a revision-pinned offline-loading contract using explicit cache/bootstrap steps, `local_files_only`/offline enforcement, telemetry disablement, and locked-dependency compatibility verification.
- Shape query/document role handling. Nomic queries require `Represent this query for searching relevant code: ` while documents do not; Crow-Plus uses no prefix. Pooling and normalization semantics must remain model-specific and card-visible.
- Produce explicit options, tradeoffs, unresolved semantic decisions, and a confirm-or-correct checkpoint suitable for later ratification.

## Acceptance criteria

- The 768- and 3,584-dimensional candidates have a side-by-side compatibility and resource decision matrix grounded in C2's immutable evidence.
- The proposed contract clearly separates content-vector dimensions from catalog-routing dimensions and covers namespace schema, cards, plans, compatibility checks, and routing behavior.
- Existing 384-dimensional namespaces/defaults have an explicit isolation or migration strategy; no silent cross-dimension query, mixed-model namespace, or default change is permitted.
- Resource bounds distinguish download/disk, model construction peak, steady host RAM, device memory, and precision/loading assumptions. Unmeasured values remain labeled estimates or blockers.
- Offline loading is revision-pinned, cache-explicit, network-failing after bootstrap, telemetry-disabled, and compatible with the locked open-source dependency path without remote code.
- Query/document prefixes, pooling, and normalization are explicit for each candidate, including Nomic's query-only prefix.
- The output records the four ratified choices and ends at one exact resource-checkpoint confirm-or-correct boundary. It creates only draft focused specifications and no executable implementation/evaluation ticket.
- The shaping work records that no model/dependency download or install, model load, inference, credential access, live service call, source/test/lockfile change, or namespace/card/catalog/default write occurred.

## Blockers

The four pilot choices are ratified, but this ticket remains active pending independent review and approval/correction of the exact proposed resource checkpoint in `.10x/specs/crow-plus-resource-verification-checkpoint.md`. Both focused specs remain draft. No executable implementation/evaluation ticket may be created until the checkpoint is approved and the governing specifications are activated. Bootstrap, bounded measurement, implementation, and indexing/write each remain separately blocked on their own later approval.

## Explicit exclusions

Active behavior specifications or decisions; executable implementation/evaluation tickets; model promotion; source, tests, configuration, dependencies, or lockfile changes; model/dependency downloads or installs; model loading or inference; credentials or live service calls; namespace, card, catalog, or default mutation; C4 execution or unblocking; migration execution; public CLI/API behavior.

## Evidence expectations

C2's immutable model evidence, inspected current source and locked open-source package contracts, a compatibility/resource/options matrix, explicit unknowns and decision questions, and a no-download/no-load/no-source/no-remote-write statement.

## Progress and notes

- 2026-07-20: Opened from the user's explicit approval to shape dynamic content-vector dimensions after C2's reviewed stop. No active behavior spec, candidate approval, download/install, model load, inference, source/test/lockfile change, namespace/card/catalog/default write, credential access, or live Buoy operation was authorized or performed.
- 2026-07-20: Completed initial record-only shaping at `.10x/research/2026-07-20-dynamic-content-vector-dimensions.md` with immutable 768/3,584 candidate bytes, explicit unmeasured RAM/device categories, strict 384 routing separation, versioned-card options, new-namespace/no-migration isolation, plan/apply/retrieval/automatic-routing failure contracts, pinned offline bootstrap/runtime controls, model-specific role semantics, implementation implications, stop conditions, and a confirm-or-correct checkpoint. Evidence: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-20-dynamic-content-vector-dimension-shaping.md`. Ticket remained active pending required independent review; no executable implementation/evaluation ticket was created.
- 2026-07-20: Applied the user's four ratified choices: Crow-Plus 768 first; explicit namespace only with no card/catalog/automatic routing; complete vector/resource/output staging before write 1; and separate bootstrap, bounded-measurement, implementation, and indexing/write approvals. Drafted `.10x/specs/crow-plus-explicit-namespace-pilot.md` and `.10x/specs/crow-plus-resource-verification-checkpoint.md`. The experimental path stages every vector before a separately approved serial write and leaves the active depth-one default untouched. Read-only host inspection informed one exact conservative proposed checkpoint; thresholds remain unratified, both specs remain draft, and no executable implementation/evaluation ticket or operation was authorized.
