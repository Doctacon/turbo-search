# Remove Ratified Internal Buoy Ranking Judgment

## Ratified outcome

The user explicitly ratified removal of only this grade-1 judgment from `src/buoy_search/data/buoy_search_repo_search_seed_evals.json`, case `evals-composite-metrics`:

- `repo_path`: `.10x/specs/repo-search-eval-autoresearch.md`
- `grade`: `1`
- reason: `Specifies the intended metric contract and config-only autoresearch scope, but is not runtime implementation.`

The rationale is that the public Buoy corpus intentionally excludes internal `.10x` records. No other case, judgment, grade, reason, or dataset behavior is ratified for change.

## Scope

In a separate implementation change, remove exactly the ratified judgment and regenerate every contract-v1-derived dataset count/hash, inventory payload/hash, evidence statement/table, validator expectation, and focused test expectation affected by that one deletion. Preserve all other dataset content and the frozen source/corpus mapping.

## Acceptance criteria

- Exactly the named grade-1 judgment is removed; all other dataset-local case IDs, questions, judgments, grades, reasons, and metadata remain unchanged.
- Buoy judgment count changes from 33 to 32 and the all-repository total changes from 370 to 369; all dataset, bundle, inventory payload, and whole-file hashes are regenerated consistently rather than hand-waved.
- Path validation resolves every remaining judgment, while Buoy remains explicitly `insufficient` because `github-doctacon-buoy-search-v1` is still `pending_approval` and its remote contents/model compatibility are unverified.
- C3 and dependent comparison work remain blocked until the exact retrieval approval gate and Buoy baseline compatibility requirements are independently satisfied.
- Focused validator tests, full Python 3.11/3.13 suites, CI-equivalent checks, diff hygiene, and independent review pass.
- No namespace, catalog, model, credential, provider, retrieval, or remote state is read or mutated.

## Evidence expectations

A semantic before/after proving only the named judgment changed; regenerated count/hash output; validator and full-suite output on Python 3.11 and 3.13; independent review; explicit confirmation that Buoy remains insufficient and no namespace operation occurred.

## Blockers

None for a future bounded implementation. This follow-up was intentionally not executed or rehashed during C1 closure.

## Explicit exclusions

Any other label edit or review; treating assistant-drafted labels as human ground truth; creating/populating/verifying `github-doctacon-buoy-search-v1`; retrieval or provider calls; namespace/catalog/default changes; unblocking or executing C3+; altering C7/C8 threshold gates.

## Progress and notes

- 2026-07-20: Opened as the separate owner for the user's exact post-review ratification. C1 closure did not edit the dataset, change 370-count/hash artifacts, or imply Buoy sufficiency.
