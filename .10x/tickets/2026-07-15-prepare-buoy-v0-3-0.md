# Prepare Buoy v0.3.0

## Scope

- Bump `pyproject.toml`, `src/buoy_search/__init__.py`, and lock metadata to 0.3.0.
- Move current release changes from Unreleased into a pending 0.3.0 changelog section covering production catalog, apply registration/recovery, opt-in auto-routing, and migration to the `.buoy` default.
- Update release documentation/examples to v0.3.0 where they describe the next release procedure.
- Retain deprecated `turbo-search` and `TURBO_SEARCH_*` aliases through 0.3 and update their announced removal target to 0.4; do not alter compatibility implementation.
- Run full CI-equivalent tests, build, tag/version dry checks, artifact inspection, docs/reference checks, and independent review.
- Land through a passing `work/* -> develop` pull request using squash merge.

## Acceptance criteria

- All authoritative version fields and built artifact names/metadata are exactly 0.3.0.
- Changelog is accurate, pending until hosted release verification, and retains valid compare links.
- Deprecated aliases still work and documentation consistently targets removal in 0.4.
- Python 3.11, Python 3.13, Build distributions, full local tests, and release dry checks pass.
- No tag, GitHub Release, main mutation, PyPI, or Turbopuffer operation occurs.

## Explicit exclusions

Alias removal, state-root compatibility removal, release tag creation, main promotion, unrelated cleanup.
