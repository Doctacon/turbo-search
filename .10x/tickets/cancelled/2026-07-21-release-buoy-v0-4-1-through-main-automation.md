# Release Buoy v0.4.1 Through Main Automation

## Outcome

Exercise the ratified simple release process end to end by preparing stable Buoy 0.4.1 on `develop`, promoting it through a `develop -> main` pull request, and verifying the automatic main-push GitHub Release without manual tag, Release, environment, PyPI, or Turbopuffer operations.

## Ratified release identity

- Version: `0.4.1` (explicitly selected by the user on 2026-07-21).
- Changelog section: `## [0.4.1] - pending` below an empty `## [Unreleased]`.
- Changelog meaning: the release replaces manual tag/environment ceremony with four prospective-merge readiness checks and deterministic automatic GitHub publication on successful `main` pushes.
- Version class: patch; no new product behavior is claimed.

## Scope

1. In an isolated `work/*` worktree from current `develop`, update project/module/lock version authorities to exactly 0.4.1 and add the exact pending changelog section/link required by the active readiness spec.
2. Run repository release-policy checks, complete Python 3.11/3.13 validation, deterministic double-build comparison, artifact inspection, and clean-wheel CLI/tokenizer smoke.
3. Obtain independent review and integrate only the preparation change to protected `develop` through a passing pull request.
4. Open one pull request whose head is exact repository branch `develop` and base is `main`. If the inherited v0.4 squash topology prevents prospective-merge construction, execute only `.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-21-bridge-v0-4-squash-topology-once.md`, then resume the exact develop-to-main PR.
5. Require all four exact `Release readiness / ...` checks to pass on GitHub's prospective merge result, obtain independent promotion review, then merge through branch protection using the repository-required release merge commit.
6. Observe the automatic `main` push workflow to terminal state and verify the new annotated `v0.4.1` tag, GitHub Release `Buoy v0.4.1`, exact two assets/digests, and provenance source ref `refs/heads/main` and exact source commit.
7. Record raw hosted evidence, independent final review, and coherent closure.

## Acceptance criteria

- Project, module, and lock agree on stable `0.4.1`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` has empty Unreleased, exactly current pending 0.4.1, real dates on older sections, and correct comparison links.
- Preparation validation passes on Python 3.11 and 3.13; deterministic builds and clean-wheel/tokenizer smoke pass.
- Preparation reaches `develop` only through protected passing CI and independent review.
- The main PR source is exactly `Doctacon/buoy:develop`; all four exact readiness checks pass on the prospective merge commit.
- Main promotion occurs through the protected PR only; no force push or recurring ancestry-sync ceremony is used. The sole exact v0.4 migration bridge, if required, satisfies its focused child ticket first.
- Automatic release run succeeds from the resulting exact main commit.
- `v0.4.1` is annotated and peels to that commit; Release identity is non-draft/non-prerelease and contains exactly the expected wheel/sdist with recorded SHA-256 digests.
- `gh attestation verify` passes for both assets with repository `Doctacon/buoy`, workflow `release.yml`, source ref `refs/heads/main`, and exact source commit.
- PyPI remains absent for 0.4.1; no Turbopuffer operation occurs.
- Every unexpected partial/mismatch state stops without automated repair, overwrite, move, deletion, retry, or cleanup.

## Explicit exclusions

Product behavior changes; version other than 0.4.1; prerelease/build metadata; manual tag/Release creation; workflow dispatch; release environment recreation; PyPI; Turbopuffer; force push; ancestry sync other than the exact non-repeatable child bridge; mutation of existing releases/tags/assets/provenance; retry or repair after a partial/mismatched release state.

## Evidence expectations

Exact source/destination commits; changed version/changelog paths; local commands/results; preparation PR/checks/review/integration; main PR exact head/base and four readiness contexts; merge identity; main-push run; tag object and peel; Release/API assets and downloaded digests; provenance verification; PyPI absence; no-live-provider attestation; independent final review.

## Blockers

None. This static-version approach is superseded by `.10x/tickets/cancelled/2026-07-21-label-driven-automatic-release-plan.md`; v0.4.1 remains owned by its label-driven child.

## Progress and notes

- 2026-07-21: User explicitly requested exercising the new process by moving current develop changes to main and selected stable version 0.4.1. Read-only inspection found main `c49dc0582bf3f06a16eafdcca0707d1e64e1c58d`, develop `3d5f700ed87feedfae76eeeb226d03a9bff12b18`, project version 0.4.0, empty Unreleased, no pending newer section, and a release-automation/governance-only main delta. No version, branch, tag, Release, asset, provider, or hosted configuration state changed during shaping.
- 2026-07-21: Preparation began from exact current develop `99f7685469571cec6f3a23f95801dcb649924059` in isolated branch/worktree `work/prepare-v0-4-1`. Scope is limited to the ratified 0.4.1 version authorities, pending changelog, local validation evidence, and a protected pull request to develop; no main, release, registry, provider, or hosted-configuration mutation is authorized.
- 2026-07-21: Project/module/lock now agree on stable 0.4.1; the changelog has empty Unreleased, the exact current pending section and ratified Changed meaning, and corrected comparison links. The initial complete 3.11 suite exposed two stale 0.4.0 static assertions; those were narrowly updated to the ratified current version/changelog while preserving verified 0.4.0 history. Release policy/version/changelog checks, lock check, complete locked 3.11 and 3.13 suites (534 tests each), deterministic byte-identical double build, repository artifact inspection, and clean-wheel CLI/help/exact-tokenizer smoke all pass. Evidence: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-1-preparation.md`.
- 2026-07-21: PR #92 exact-head CI `29870237282` passed all protected develop checks. Independent review passed exact head `2b008edd2618286bb56f7693ca9204959ed81edf` with no blockers. Review: `.10x/reviews/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-1-preparation-review.md`. No main/tag/Release/PyPI/Turbopuffer/configuration mutation occurred.
- 2026-07-21: PR #92 squash-integrated to develop as `8694afc94984e6993730acd205af3bdca93c5c8b`. Exact `develop -> main` PR #93 was opened, but GitHub reports it conflicting before prospective-merge construction; only ordinary CI ran. Read-only merge-tree diagnosis attributes the conflict to the accepted v0.4 squash topology. Ticket blocked without merge/release mutation. Evidence: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-1-prospective-merge-blocker.md`.
- 2026-07-21: User explicitly ratified the recommended one-time protected, content-neutral ancestry bridge after the inherited conflict was explained. The exception is pinned to exact main `c49dc0582bf3f06a16eafdcca0707d1e64e1c58d`, requires develop-tree identity and merge-commit ancestry preservation, and cannot recur. Decision: `.10x/decisions/one-time-v0-4-squash-topology-bridge.md`.
- 2026-07-21: GitHub then reported the intentional canonical rename to `Doctacon/buoy`; the user authorized updating future release identity while preserving exact v0.4 legacy provenance under `Doctacon/buoy-search`. Reconciliation child: `.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-21-reconcile-github-repository-rename.md`. No release or provider mutation occurred.
- 2026-07-21: The exact one-time bridge completed through PR #97 as develop `5ce5c11553ac69a997b25567023b4765f5e780c8`; PR #93 became mergeable and readiness ran. The four release jobs passed but emitted bare job names that did not match configured required contexts, so protection correctly blocked merge and no release occurred.
- 2026-07-21: User rejected further static-version/process ceremony and explicitly authorized label-driven tag-derived versions, frozen changelog, merge-commit auto-merge, and automatic publication. This ticket is cancelled as superseded; achieved rename/bridge work remains valid, PR #93 remains open, and v0.4.1 transfers to `.10x/tickets/cancelled/2026-07-21-release-v0-4-1-label-driven.md`.
