# Repair Hosted Release Validation and Bump v0.2.1

## Scope

Repair annotated-tag validation to use authoritative remote GitHub metadata, bump all current version/changelog/release targets to 0.2.1, document preserved failed v0.2.0 history, validate, commit, push normally, and require passing canonical main CI.

## Acceptance criteria

- Remote annotated tag validation rejects lightweight tags and does not rely on checkout-local ref type.
- Existing v0.2.0 tag/run remain unchanged and have no Release.
- Project/module/changelog/docs agree on pending 0.2.1.
- Tests/static negatives/build/full suite pass; independent review passes.
- One normal reviewed commit is pushed to main and hosted CI passes.
- No tag/release/PyPI/branch protection/Turbopuffer mutation occurs.
