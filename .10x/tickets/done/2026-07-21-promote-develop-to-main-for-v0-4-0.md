# Promote Develop to Main for v0.4.0

## Scope

- Verify release-ready `develop`, current `main`, branch protection, historical PR #80, exact divergence, and no conflicting release operation; because PR #80 is closed at a stale conflicting head, open one replacement `develop -> main` release PR after the ancestry/governance records integrate.
- Create a dedicated ancestry-sync branch from exact release-ready `develop`, merge exact current `main` with a merge commit, and prove the resulting tree is content-identical to release-ready `develop` except for this ticket's already-reviewed release records where applicable.
- Open the ancestry-only sync PR to `develop`; require strict freshness, all three checks, exact-parent/tree evidence, and independent review; merge using a merge commit only.
- Revalidate updated `develop` and the replacement release PR, require all checks, any mechanically required last-push approval, and independent complete release-diff review, then merge it to `main` with a merge commit only.
- Verify exact parents/ancestry/tree and passing `main` push CI.

## Acceptance criteria

- Current `main` ancestry reaches `develop` through a protected PR without direct push, squash, rebase, force push, or protection change.
- The sync merge introduces no content from stale `main` over release-ready develop.
- The replacement release PR contains the exact reviewed release candidate, is clean/current, and passes Python 3.11, Python 3.13, and Build distributions.
- The replacement release PR uses the governed merge-commit method, or an explicitly user-ratified topology exception records exact tree equality and repairs released-main ancestry back into develop before new ordinary work.
- Resulting `main` tree equals reviewed release-ready develop and main push CI passes.
- Durable evidence and independent review pass; no tag/Release/PyPI/Turbopuffer operation occurs.

## Explicit exclusions

Candidate source changes after review; tag or Release creation; publication; branch protection changes; direct push; squash/rebase; Turbopuffer.

## Evidence expectations

Exact pre/post refs, divergence, sync commit parents/tree, PR/check URLs, merge methods and parents, reviewed candidate tree identity, main push CI, independent review, and explicit no-publication/no-product-state boundary.

## Blockers

None. PR #85 merged after retained hosted protection allowed the user's action. The user explicitly accepted the observed squash topology for v0.4.0, exact tree equality is proved, exact-main CI passed, and post-release content-neutral ancestry repair is prepared in this branch.

## Progress and notes

- 2026-07-21: Opened after PR #80 reported conflicts between `main` `820b8ab` and `develop` `ce262d4`. The established protected ancestry-only sync mechanism is record-backed from v0.3.0. No branch, PR, ancestry, tag, release, or product state changed.
- 2026-07-21: Reviewed candidate PR #82 integrated as exact release-ready develop `47a0c33c412062f6467b1858e411179bfca60dcf`. Dedicated ancestry merge `1abd9f587d3e188fa19be11755c786d81df3d455` has exact second parent current main `820b8abba4308481eace728203d98f3365154956` and exact tree equality `4c6395c330bb14ab75012d4b82c78f8b9a739aa8` with release-ready develop. Evidence: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-0-ancestry-sync-readiness.md`. Independent review passed exact PR #83 head `cf08383f4c62559a29369b33b7d87f38919ad507`; GitHub merged it with merge commit `3dd1c72f5e75785c11530dc24f34067c6983b1c6`, exact parents release-ready develop and reviewed sync head. No direct protected-branch mutation, tag, Release, PyPI, Turbopuffer, or user-state operation occurred.
- 2026-07-21: Hosted inspection found main protection allowed force pushes and required last-push approval, differing from the superseded governance contract. The user explicitly selected `Keep current rules` and then directed release execution. `.10x/decisions/protected-development-and-github-release-governance-v2.md` and `.10x/specs/protected-github-branches.md` retain the exact settings without changing hosted protection and continue to prohibit using force push or bypass. Hosted state also proves PR #80 is closed, conflicting, and pinned to stale head `a2142205cae8ccfce9ed5f4d3b4785413621812b`; replacement PR #85 was opened from current develop.
- 2026-07-21: Independent readiness review passed PR #85 content, ancestry, version, exact-head CI, and merge-commit topology at develop `35cf2d6e4da48a5e84c7f97d9e81e8f13950b504`; review: `.10x/reviews/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-0-main-promotion-readiness-review.md`. It remained mechanically blocked on eligible last-push approval. The review also found and PR #86 repaired three non-existent PR #82 SHA citations to actual `278400909596b5644431bd03fe526e600153f152`.
- 2026-07-21: The user merged PR #85 with squash commit `c49dc0582bf3f06a16eafdcca0707d1e64e1c58d`, tree-exact to reviewed develop `e702aee115a57b5057b8d5d5917b260e6417c74d` but without develop ancestry. After the conflict with the active merge-commit contract was named, the user explicitly selected `Accept and release (Recommended)`. Exact-main CI run `29851219914` passed. Content-neutral post-release sync commit `644867f9ef8a26b137e0aabf69cb0cf4f66601a3` now has released main as second parent and the same exact tree. Evidence: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-0-main-promotion.md`.
- 2026-07-21: Independent post-release audit passed promotion topology, exact tree/CI, explicit exception, and post-release sync; review: `.10x/reviews/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-0-release-review.md`. Integration must use a merge commit so released-main ancestry is preserved.

## Closure mapping

- Candidate content and independent readiness: PR #82 evidence/review and `.10x/reviews/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-0-main-promotion-readiness-review.md`.
- Protected pre-release ancestry: PR #83 and `.10x/evidence/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-0-ancestry-sync-readiness.md`.
- Actual main promotion, explicit topology exception, exact tree, main CI, and post-release ancestry repair: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-0-main-promotion.md`.
- No force/direct push, protection mutation, PyPI, or Turbopuffer operation occurred.

## Retrospective

GitHub permits squash on release PRs even when project governance requires merge commits. Release instructions must make the merge-method choice visible to the human operator; if a squash occurs, exact tree equality plus an explicit user exception and content-neutral main-to-develop sync prevent content loss and repeated future divergence.
