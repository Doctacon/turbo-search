# Create Buoy v0.4.0 GitHub Release

## Scope

- Preflight exact reviewed main/version/CI, immutable prior tags/releases, absent v0.4.0 conflicts, release environment approval, dry tag/assets checks, and no PyPI publication.
- Create and push annotated `v0.4.0` from the exact reviewed main commit only.
- Verify authoritative remote metadata reports an annotated tag object peeled to that main commit.
- Observe the unique workflow through validation/build and the protected `release` environment wait; approve only the expected run/commit/version/artifacts.
- Verify successful Release publication, exact wheel/sdist identities and digests, generated notes, and provenance attestation.
- Record complete evidence and obtain independent review.

## Acceptance criteria

- No v0.4.0 tag, release, or conflicting workflow exists before mutation.
- Annotated v0.4.0 points to exact reviewed main and remote object type is `tag`.
- Validation/build pass before environment approval; approval targets only the expected deployment.
- Release contains exactly the expected 0.4.0 wheel/sdist with verified digests and provenance.
- No PyPI, branch/source mutation, tag overwrite, release replacement, Turbopuffer operation, or user-state mutation occurs.
- Evidence and independent review pass before closure.

## Explicit exclusions

Source/changelog finalization; PyPI; deleting/replacing tags or releases; branch protection; Turbopuffer.

## Evidence expectations

Exact main/tag object/peeled commit; preflight state; workflow/run/jobs/artifacts/deployment/approval identity and chronology; release ID/URL/assets/digests; provenance; no-PyPI observation; review.

## Blockers

None. Main promotion and exact-main CI completed before tag creation; the exact GitHub-only release is published and verified.

## Progress and notes

- 2026-07-21: Read-only planning preflight found no local/remote `v0.4.0` tag or GitHub Release and found the `release` environment configured with required reviewer `Doctacon`, self-review allowed. No tag, workflow, deployment, release, or publication was created.
- 2026-07-21: Exact-main preflight passed at accepted release commit `c49dc0582bf3f06a16eafdcca0707d1e64e1c58d`; main CI run `29851219914` passed, version/tag/assets checks passed, v0.4.0 conflicts were absent, and PyPI returned 404. Created/pushed annotated tag object `1a527da870a1b6d8acedee8b93dbf85d24dac8b9` peeled to exact main. Release run `29851435791` passed validation/build before waiting on release environment `18151168858`; exact deployment approval then gated successful provenance and publication job `88705440328`. Release `357504706` contains exact wheel/sdist digests and both downloaded assets pass `gh attestation verify`; PyPI remains absent. Evidence: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-0-github-release.md`.
- 2026-07-21: Independent post-release audit passed tag/workflow/deployment chronology, Release/assets/digests, SLSA provenance, no-PyPI, and ticket graph; review: `.10x/reviews/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-0-release-review.md`.

## Closure mapping

- Preflight, annotated tag object, exact peeled main, workflow chronology, environment approval, Release identity, assets/digests, provenance, and no-PyPI: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-21-buoy-v0-4-0-github-release.md`.
- Release URL: `https://github.com/Doctacon/buoy-search/releases/tag/v0.4.0`.
- No branch/protection mutation, tag overwrite, Release replacement, Turbopuffer operation, or user-state mutation occurred.

## Retrospective

The release boundary is two-stage: immutable tag push begins the hosted run, while environment approval separately gates provenance and Release creation. Revalidate exact run/commit/artifacts and absent Release immediately before approval.
