# Finalize v0.2.1 Release Documentation

## Scope

Replace the pending 0.2.1 changelog marker with the verified release date, add canonical release/compare links, repair parent/temporal record paths and state, validate, create one reviewed documentation/record commit, push normally, and require passing CI.

## Acceptance criteria

- CHANGELOG and release docs reflect published v0.2.1 accurately.
- Parent/child/evidence references and statuses are coherent.
- No release asset/tag/PyPI/branch-protection/product behavior changes.
- Focused/full validation, independent review, normal commit/push, and CI pass.

## Progress and notes

- 2026-07-14: Finalized the verified v0.2.1 changelog, release review, terminal graph paths, and parent state; focused 9 and full 235 tests plus lock/diff checks pass. Evidence: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-14-finalize-v0-2-1-release-docs.md`.
- 2026-07-14: Committed `f4ba77360912a6f72f514c31fd2c311145e65285`, pushed normally to canonical main, and observed hosted CI run `29363465444` succeed on the exact commit.

## Blockers

- Required commit/push, hosted CI, and independent review before closure.
