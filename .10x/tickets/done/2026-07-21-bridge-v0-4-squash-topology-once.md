# Bridge v0.4 Squash Topology Once

## Outcome

Perform the exact user-ratified, protected, content-neutral, non-repeatable bridge that makes v0.4 main commit `c49dc0582bf3f06a16eafdcca0707d1e64e1c58d` an ancestor of then-current develop without changing develop's tree, then prove PR #93 can construct its prospective merge result.

## Scope

1. After the governing PR #94 is reviewed and integrated, fetch exact remote state and bind `D` to current `origin/develop`.
2. Revalidate exact main `c49dc0582bf3f06a16eafdcca0707d1e64e1c58d`, PR #93 `CONFLICTING/DIRTY`, and absence of v0.4.1 tag/Release.
3. From exact `D`, create isolated `work/bridge-v0-4-squash-topology-once` and one merge commit whose first parent is `D`, whose other parent is exact main, and whose tree is byte-identical to `D`.
4. Push only that task branch; open a protected PR to develop; require strict protected Python 3.11, Python 3.13, and Build distributions checks.
5. Obtain independent review of commit parents, exact tree identity, diff absence, remote identities, and non-mutation boundaries.
6. A dedicated integration action MUST merge the bridge PR with a merge commit, not squash/rebase, and MUST NOT alter protection.
7. Verify resulting develop tree equals `D`, exact main is an ancestor of develop, no release state changed, and refreshed/recreated exact `develop -> main` PR #93 becomes mergeable and starts the four readiness checks.
8. Record evidence/review and close this child. The bridge MUST NOT recur.

## Acceptance criteria

- Governing decision/spec exception is integrated before bridge creation.
- Exact main identity is unchanged and no v0.4.1 tag/Release exists before execution.
- Bridge task commit has exact parents and exact develop-parent tree.
- Bridge PR has zero file-content delta and all protected develop checks pass.
- Independent review passes before integration.
- Integration uses merge-commit ancestry preservation through protected PR; no direct/force push, rebase, squash, or protection change occurs.
- Final develop tree equals pre-bridge `D`; exact main is an ancestor of final develop.
- No source/version/changelog/workflow/product/tag/Release/asset/PyPI/Turbopuffer/configuration state changes.
- PR #93 can construct a prospective merge result after develop advances.

## Explicit exclusions

Any content change; any main commit other than exact `c49dc05`; recurring ancestry sync; squash/rebase/direct/force push; protection mutation; main merge; tag/Release/asset/provenance mutation; PyPI; Turbopuffer; retry after an identity/tree mismatch.

## Evidence expectations

Exact refs/parents/tree IDs; pre/post protection and release-state observations; PR/check identities; independent review; integration method/commit; ancestry proof; tree equality; PR #93 mergeability/readiness run; no-live-operation attestation.

## Blockers

None.

## Progress and notes

- 2026-07-21: Opened from the user-ratified exact bridge contract. No bridge branch, commit, merge, release, provider, or configuration mutation occurred.
- 2026-07-21: PR #97 carried exact zero-content bridge `691d28e543659a2ef11acc47e66f5f8993e8c64b`; strict CI `29875124848` and independent review passed. Protected merge-commit integration produced develop `5ce5c11553ac69a997b25567023b4765f5e780c8` with unchanged tree, exact main/bridge ancestry, unchanged protection/release state, and mergeable PR #93. Evidence: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-21-v0-4-squash-topology-bridge.md`; review: `.10x/reviews/2026-07-21-v0-4-squash-topology-bridge-review.md`.

## Closure mapping

All acceptance criteria map to the evidence/review above. The one-time exception is consumed and must not recur.

## Retrospective

A zero-content topology operation can appear as a no-edit worker failure; acceptance must inspect commit parents/tree rather than file changes.
