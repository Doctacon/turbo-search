# Add Interactive Apply Confirmation

## Scope

Implement `.10x/specs/interactive-apply-confirmation.md` after the retrieval-default child integrates:

- add explicit `apply --dry-run` preflight;
- make interactive plain apply display complete preflight then prompt `Apply this plan? [y/N] `;
- exact `y`/`yes` enters the existing approved path with full revalidation;
- every other input/EOF safely cancels exit 0 with zero side effects;
- retain `--approve` as non-interactive/automation confirmation;
- fail plain non-TTY apply before plan work;
- use the DuckDB-only non-mutating preflight path established by the preceding hard-cutover child;
- update apply help, output, README/docs/changelog, workflow knowledge, and examples.

## Acceptance criteria

- Mode precedence proves `--dry-run --approve` fails before plan selection or side effects.
- TTY fakes cover `y`, `yes`, case/whitespace, Enter, no, arbitrary input, EOF, and prompt I/O failure.
- Prompt ordering proves complete visible preflight occurs before prompt and every approved-only constructor/read/write occurs after confirmation.
- Confirmation re-enters the same approved pipeline and revalidates plan/artifact/state/lock/pending/remote invariants.
- Cancellation text/JSON (`dry_run=false`, `cancelled=true`), exit 0, plan retention, zero model/credential/API/pending/state/catalog/content effects, and clean JSON stdout are proven.
- Obsolete-JSON fixtures prove `--dry-run`, cancellation, and confirmed apply ignore it byte-for-byte; no compatibility read, migration, deletion, warning, or error occurs.
- Non-TTY plain apply fails before plan selection and names `--dry-run`/`--approve`; piped yes cannot confirm.
- `--dry-run` remains local/model/credential/API-free and works non-interactively; `--approve` remains prompt-free and compatible.
- Existing stale deletion, batching/timing, lock, pending recovery, catalog registration, cleanup, and failure tests remain protective.
- Focused/full Python 3.11/3.13 tests, distributions, evidence, independent review, and hosted checks pass.

## Evidence expectations

Captured TTY/non-TTY call ordering and streams; exact side-effect sentinels; text/JSON snapshots; compatibility suites; full/hosted check identities.

## Blockers

None.

## Explicit exclusions

Catalog command prompts/defaults; immediate non-interactive writes; config/env auto-confirm; piped approval; changed stale deletion or remote recovery semantics; release.

## Progress and notes

- 2026-07-18: Dependency `.10x/tickets/done/2026-07-18-remove-legacy-json-applied-state.md` is integrated at `686435c`; implementation started on `work/add-interactive-apply-confirmation` from the matching `develop` head.
- 2026-07-18: Implemented apply mode gating, explicit prompt-free dry-run, exact TTY confirmation, safe cancellation/prompt failure, clean JSON/text output, and confirmation entry into the unchanged approved pipeline with locked revalidation. Updated help, README, indexing guide, changelog, workflow skill/reference, and focused tests.
- 2026-07-18: Focused 109-test and full 413-test suites passed on Python 3.11 and 3.13; wheel/sdist build, exact asset validation, compile, diff, staged-file, and obsolete-JSON production-source checks passed. Evidence: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-18-interactive-apply-confirmation.md`.
- 2026-07-18: Opened PR #37. Hosted Python 3.11, Python 3.13, and distribution-build checks passed in Actions run `29692276509` for implementation commit `7b6d684`; implementation session left the ticket active for independent review.
- 2026-07-18: Independent review passed at final implementation/evidence head `b74263f267148f162817216ea01696386e183091`; no blocker remained. Review: `.10x/reviews/2026-07-18-interactive-apply-confirmation-review.md`.

## Closure mapping

- Mode precedence/non-TTY boundary: focused call-order tests and independent source review.
- Complete preflight/prompt/confirmation semantics: TTY input matrix, exact stderr prompt assertions, cancellation/prompt-failure tests, and reviewed CLI flow.
- Approved-path identity and revalidation: unchanged approved implementation plus lock/artifact/state/pending tests and review.
- Cancellation/dry-run output and zero side effects: text/JSON snapshots and exact model/credential/API/pending/state/catalog/content sentinels.
- DuckDB-only obsolete JSON behavior: integrated hard-cutover regressions plus interactive apply fixtures.
- Stale deletion, timing, batching, locks, recovery, catalog registration, cleanup: protective focused/full suites remain passing.
- Validation: 109 focused and 413 full tests on Python 3.11/3.13, distributions, assets, compile, source/diff checks, hosted checks, evidence, and pass review.

## Retrospective

The safest simplification was to keep one approved pipeline and make interactive confirmation only a gate into it. Reusing the full locked revalidation path avoids creating a second write implementation or trusting stale preflight results. Prompt and diagnostics on stderr preserve one-document JSON stdout.
