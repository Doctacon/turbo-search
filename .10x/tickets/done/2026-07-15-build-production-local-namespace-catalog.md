# Build Production Local Namespace Catalog

## Outcome

Implement the canonical local catalog model, persistence, pinned card-vector projection, and complete local catalog management CLI governed by `.10x/specs/superseded/production-local-namespace-catalog.md`.

## Branch and worktree

Execute on `work/build-production-local-namespace-catalog` in its own worktree from current integrated `develop`.

## Scope

- Add the smallest production catalog module and typed card/document/error models.
- Implement state-root/catalog path resolution and exact CLI/environment precedence, existing stable-JSON canonical hashes/golden fixtures, strict loaders, atomic lock-protected mutation, and vector validation.
- Implement deterministic card text, pinned local-only model construction, vector creation/reuse, and generated semantic helpers needed by later apply work.
- Add `catalog list`, `show`, `upsert`, `enable`, `disable`, and approved local-only `remove` commands with text/JSON output.
- Expose a narrow validated card merge/commit API for later apply reconciliation without implementing apply integration yet.
- Add focused unit/CLI tests for every catalog acceptance scenario, complete source-kind/URI mapping and contradictions, 384-dimension contract, golden passage/hash/vector fixtures, corruption/concurrency, model no-download behavior, mutation safety, and no credential/Turbopuffer access.
- Update user documentation for catalog creation and management.
- Record evidence and obtain independent review before closure.

## Acceptance criteria

- Catalog schema, revisions, semantic/retrieval/routing contracts, hashes, ordering, strict unknown-field rejection, and vectors match the active spec.
- Local state mutation is atomic and lock-protected; failed writes preserve prior bytes.
- Manual upsert creates or updates manual semantics and persisted vectors without contacting Turbopuffer or reading credentials.
- Enable/disable preserve semantic/vector fields; remove is preview-only without `--approve` and never deletes remote/applied state.
- Read commands do not load the model and hide vectors by default.
- Generated semantic helper behavior is deterministic and independently testable.
- Existing CLI commands and explicit retrieval remain compatible.
- No remote catalog, apply integration, automatic routing, ACL, graph, taxonomy, tag filter, telemetry, or new dependency is added.
- Focused tests, full suite, and `git diff --check` pass.
- Independent review has no unresolved significant finding.

## Explicit exclusions

- mutation during plan/apply;
- pending apply registration/reconciliation command wiring;
- `retrieve --auto-route`;
- Turbopuffer namespace listing/query/write;
- import from remote namespace IDs;
- multi-user permissions;
- model download or hosted embedding API.

## Evidence expectations

Evidence must cover schema/hash fixtures, atomic/lock failure behavior, vector model/revision/hash validation, no-download/no-credential/no-Turbopuffer sentinels, every catalog CLI operation, explicit retrieval regression, full validation, and diff boundaries.

## Blockers

None after shaping review/integration.

## Progress and notes

- 2026-07-15: Opened as the first executable child. No implementation occurred in the specification-authoring turn.
- 2026-07-15: Implementation active on `work/build-production-local-namespace-catalog`. Added the strict canonical catalog model/store, pinned local-only routing projection, deterministic generated-semantic and manual-preserving merge helpers, local catalog CLI lifecycle, documentation, and focused tests. Apply/pending reconciliation and automatic routing remain explicitly excluded.
- 2026-07-15: Focused catalog tests passed (32), the full suite passed (324), Python compilation and `git diff --check` passed, and the exact cached model produced a finite normalized 384-dimensional vector under forced offline mode. Evidence: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-15-production-local-namespace-catalog-implementation.md`. Ticket remains active pending independent review.
- 2026-07-15: Repaired independent-review blockers without widening scope: strict persisted lineage with separate prospective preparation, exact JSON integers, strict metadata and source-kind URI validation, direct file/directory fsync and credential-read sentinel coverage, catalog-specific both-root guidance, and explicit retrieval environment documentation. Focused tests passed (37), full suite passed (329), compilation and diff check passed. Ticket remains active for rereview.

- 2026-07-15: Two independent re-reviewers passed corrective commit `e13d3e1`; durable review: `.10x/reviews/2026-07-15-production-local-namespace-catalog-review.md`.

## Closure mapping

- Catalog schema, exact hashes, persisted vectors, atomic locking/persistence, local-only model loading, source generation, manual merge API, and CLI lifecycle map to focused tests and recorded evidence.
- Initial lineage/type/URI/sentinel findings were corrected and independently re-reviewed.
- Thirty-seven focused and 329 full-suite tests, compilation, and `git diff --check` passed.
- No excluded apply/routing/remote behavior or dependency was added.

## Retrospective

Persisted control-plane JSON requires exact type checks rather than equality-coercible numbers, and source identity validation must be source-kind-aware. These invariants now live in the strict catalog loader/tests and active specification. No separate follow-up is needed; apply registration remains owned by the next child.
