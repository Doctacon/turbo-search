# Reconcile GitHub Repository Rename

## Outcome

Reconcile active repository/release authority from `Doctacon/buoy-search` to the user-ratified canonical `Doctacon/buoy` before the v0.4.1 topology bridge and promotion, while preserving immutable v0.4.0 provenance and historical source/evidence identities.

## Scope

- Introduce explicit current repository identity `Doctacon/buoy` in release automation and readiness policy.
- Preserve a separate exact legacy v0.4.0 provenance repository pin `Doctacon/buoy-search`; do not overload one constant for current and legacy identity.
- Update active release tests, fake-host fixtures, package project URLs, current changelog links, and active release documentation to canonical `https://github.com/Doctacon/buoy`.
- Inspect every old-identity occurrence and classify it as active-current (update), immutable legacy v0.4 provenance (preserve), historical record/source pin (preserve), or generic fixture (update only when it represents current repository identity).
- Update the local `origin` URL to the canonical repository after protected integration; do not rewrite historical commits or hosted release objects.
- Run focused release-policy/state-machine tests, complete locked Python 3.11/3.13 suites, deterministic build/artifact/clean-wheel checks, exact v0.4 legacy no-op inspection, and hosted CI.
- Obtain independent review and integrate through an ordinary protected squash PR to develop.

## Acceptance criteria

- Readiness accepts only exact `Doctacon/buoy:develop` for future release PRs.
- v0.4.1/future release inspection and provenance require repository `Doctacon/buoy`.
- Exact published v0.4.0 legacy no-op still accepts only immutable historical repository `Doctacon/buoy-search` plus every existing pin; no other version can use the old identity.
- Active project/changelog/docs links use canonical `Doctacon/buoy`; distribution/package/import/CLI identities remain unchanged.
- Historical evidence/source pins are not semantically rewritten.
- Tests prove current-vs-legacy repository separation and fail closed on cross-use.
- Full local/hosted validation passes with deterministic artifacts and clean install.
- No main/tag/Release/asset/provenance/PyPI/Turbopuffer/protection/product behavior mutation occurs.

## Explicit exclusions

Distribution/package/CLI rename; mutation of historical releases/provenance; rewriting historical observations or immutable experiment sources; main merge; topology bridge; tag/Release creation; PyPI; Turbopuffer; protection changes; redirect-dependent acceptance.

## Evidence expectations

Canonical hosted repository identity; classified occurrence inventory; exact diff; current/legacy state tests; local and hosted validation; artifact hashes; independent review; integrated develop identity; origin URL readback; no-live-mutation attestation.

## Blockers

None. PR #94 integrated the governing rename decision/spec changes as exact develop `0c7f333d45622ff2ffea62e5ac9e0b00a109a4d1`.

## Progress and notes

- 2026-07-21: During a governance push, GitHub reported the canonical repository had moved to `Doctacon/buoy`. The user confirmed the rename was intentional and authorized reconciliation. No release, branch, protection, provider, or product state changed during shaping.
- 2026-07-21: Execution began in isolated `work/reconcile-github-repository-rename` from exact develop `0c7f333d45622ff2ffea62e5ac9e0b00a109a4d1`. Local origin fetch/push already resolve directly to `git@github.com:Doctacon/buoy.git`. Initial occurrence classification preserves immutable experimental source pins, historical records/evidence, and exact released-version provenance while updating active release automation/readiness, current project/docs/changelog URLs, and current-identity fixtures.
- 2026-07-21: Implementation and local validation complete. Current release authority is exact `Doctacon/buoy`; exact legacy v0.4.0 provenance is separately pinned to `Doctacon/buoy-search`; tests fail closed on current/legacy cross-use. Focused tests passed (44), complete locked 3.11 and 3.13 suites passed (535 each), deterministic double build/artifact/clean-wheel/tokenizer checks passed, and exact live read-only v0.4 inspection produced `noop` with every historical pin. Evidence: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-21-github-repository-rename-reconciliation.md`.
- 2026-07-21: Commit `310d37f27eeef74806356d8925dc5f9f9035ba58` was pushed only to the task branch and opened as protected PR #95 targeting `develop`. Exact-head hosted CI run `29873714541` passed Python 3.11, Python 3.13, and Build distributions. No main, tag, Release, asset, provenance, PyPI, Turbopuffer, protection, or product mutation occurred.
- 2026-07-21: Independent review passed after correcting two evidence-only SHA typos; final-head CI `29874589384` passed. PR #95 squash-integrated to develop as `24238e3660446e2108e3b9c142548e66d6c589d5`. Review: `.10x/reviews/2026-07-21-github-repository-rename-implementation-review.md`.

## Closure mapping

- Implementation/validation: `.10x/evidence/2026-07-21-github-repository-rename-reconciliation.md`.
- Independent review: `.10x/reviews/2026-07-21-github-repository-rename-implementation-review.md`.
- Integration: PR #95 / `24238e3660446e2108e3b9c142548e66d6c589d5`.

## Retrospective

Repository identity and immutable provenance identity require separate constants; redirects are not exact release authority.
